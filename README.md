# Ecoforce
Web Application to find Ontario based energy and sustainability  funding opportunities for small business companies
# Problem
Numerous funding opportunities exist for companies investing in sustainable and energy-efficient projects. Unfortunately, scouring the internet for appropriate funding sources is ineffective in securing financial support. Researching various websites and options can be time-consuming and demanding, and even then, companies may not be aware of all the available opportunities or eligible funding sources. As a result, companies may miss out on valuable funding, resulting in fewer energy projects.
